The dataset we are using is from Kaggle called “US Accidents (4.2 million records) - A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020).” 
At the time of data gathering, the datset consists of data from car accidents that occurred in 49 states of America from February 2016 to December 2020.
It has used a set of APIs which gave data for streaming events or incidents. The APIs broadcast data from traffic that was taken with a range of entities.
Such as road-network traffic sensors, cameras, agencies from law enforcement, and the state and US departments of transportation. At the time of data gathering, 
the dataset consists of approximately 4.2 million records.Severity levels are classified in order between 1 and 4, where 1 shows the minimum impact of the accident 
on traffic and 4 shows the high impact of the accident (i.e., long delay).	

#### Sample Data Set : out.csv is a sample data file, which can be used for evaluation.

## Objective:							
The objective of this project is subcategorized as follows:					

●  Analyzing the essential features impacting the severity of accidents, including environmental factors such as weather, road features, time, temperature, etc.
 										
●  Developing a model that can predict accident severity more accurately. 



## Algorithms used:	

Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Logical Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine
